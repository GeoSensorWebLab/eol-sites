    <h1>About the GeoCENS RPI Workbench</h1>

    <p>The RPI Workbench is a JavaScript Single-Page Application front-end to the GeoCENS Data Service. It was produced as part of the GeoCENS RPI project in collaboration with <a href="http://canarie.ca/">CANARIE</a>.</p>

    <p>The Data Service is deprecated and no longer supported. It has been completely replaced by <a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/sensorthings">OGC SensorThings API</a>, a standardized and easy to implement client/server architecture for sensor data and metadata access.</p>
