    <h1>About the GeoCENS Data Service</h1>

    <p>The Data Service functioned as an API and online index/database of sensor data for the <a href="http://www.geocens.ca">GeoCENS Project</a>. It provided a REST-like HTTP API for web and JavaScript clients and sought to provide a faster experience over Sensor Observation Service. Both the service and SDK were built under the <a href="http://canarie.ca/">CANARIE</a> RPI program.</p>

    <p>The Data Service is deprecated and no longer supported. It has been completely replaced by <a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/sensorthings">OGC SensorThings API</a>, a standardized and easy to implement client/server architecture for sensor data and metadata access.</p>
